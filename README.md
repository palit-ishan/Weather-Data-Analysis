This Repo Contains Project Done as Volunteer Research Assistant at Northeastern University, Boston for the Dept of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.

This project will create a data pipeline to retrieve weather data from a free weather API, process it, and store it in a database for future use.

Components:

1. API Client: Python script to call the weather API and fetch data.
2. Data Processing: Clean and format the retrieved data.
3. Database Storage: Store the processed data in a database (SQLite).
4. Scheduler: Automate data retrieval at regular intervals.
